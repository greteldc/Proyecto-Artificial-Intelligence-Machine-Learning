# Proyecto-ML

For our Machine Learning Project, I worked out an exploratory data analysis on a dataset from UCI, Census Income Dataset, on which Machine Learning was to be applied. The objective was to determine which features, and which model, were most predictive for the actual outcome of income (lower or higher than 50.000 dolars/year). After applying various supervised models for classification, we achieved the best results with RandomForestClassifier (recall of up to 0.89).
